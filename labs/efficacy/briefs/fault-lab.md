You are one AstraNull efficacy-lab worker. Model: Gemini 3.8 Flash High. Work only this lab.

Read first, and obey: /Users/checkred_admin/Projects/astranull/labs/efficacy/CONTRACT.md
Repo: /Users/checkred_admin/Projects/astranull
Today: 2026-10-17. Docker is Colima (10 CPU, about 14 GiB) and is already running.

Safety (hard):
- Traffic stays on the lab networks in 172.31.0.0/16 that you create. internal: true. No public targets, no scans of the host, no traffic to the internet except docker pull and image builds.
- No attack or flood tooling. No sqlmap, nikto, hping, slowloris, load generators, packet spoofing, amplification scripts, monlist, memcached stats dumps, or exploit apps (no DVWA, WebGoat, Juice Shop).
- The only request payloads you may send for a proof are the exact inert markers and bounded probes already implemented in the repo, copied from source, plus plain health requests (GET /, dig of your lab zone, a single TCP connect). Do not invent new exploit strings.
- Never push images, never docker login, never publish ports except 127.0.0.1 when the contract allows and you cannot avoid it.
- Never stop, remove, or modify containers, networks, or volumes you did not create. Do not touch names starting with bgp- or astranull-postgres-local. Prefix every resource with anl-<lab-id>.
- Repository source is read-only. Do not edit src/, workers/, tests/, scripts/, db/, docs/, apps/, ops/, PROGRESS.md, package.json, or CONTRACT.md. Write only your lab directory and /tmp/astranull-lab/<lab-id>/.
- No git commands that change state. No secrets. Synthetic data only.
- Every service: cpus at most 1.0, mem_limit at most 768m. If docker info shows little free memory, wait and retry. Do not kill other containers.
- Leave the lab RUNNING when you finish. down.sh removes only your project.

Colima fact: the Mac host cannot route to container IPs. Prove each planted condition with a throwaway container attached to your lab network (curl, nc, dig, or a single TCP connect). Remove that throwaway when the proof is recorded. Do not enable IPv6 on the Colima daemon. A network with enable_ipv6 is fine; if the daemon refuses, record the blocker and do not reconfigure Colima.

Ground truth is the lab config, not AstraNull. In manifest expectations, use expected protected, gap, not_applicable, or inconclusive_expected only for checks whose behavior you proved or that you read in source and can justify. Do not invent a long guess list. Read the check definition and the probe it sends before you name it.

Done: STATUS.md updated, REPORT.md with image ids (docker image inspect --format '{{.Id}}'), health proof, and limitations. Your final message is at most 25 lines. No secrets.

Lab id: fault-lab
Write only: /Users/checkred_admin/Projects/astranull/labs/efficacy/envs/fault-lab/ and /tmp/astranull-lab/fault-lab/
Compose project anl-fault-lab. Network mode none for the fault container. Cap cpus 1.0 and mem_limit 768m. Capabilities limited to NET_ADMIN and NET_RAW.

There is already a sketch at tests/fixtures/connect-fault-lab/. You may read it. Do not edit it. Rebuild under your lab directory.

Plant one exact client/server tuple DROP (iptables) so a connect to that tuple times out, and show the rule counter increments only for that tuple. A second tuple on the same container must still complete a TCP handshake to a local listener. Proof is tcpdump or conntrack/iptables counters inside the container, plus the two connect results. This is a firewall fixture, not a flood.

The signed probe worker cannot join network none. In the manifest, mark catalog checks not_applicable with that reason, and record the independent proof in REPORT.md. Do not publish ports.
