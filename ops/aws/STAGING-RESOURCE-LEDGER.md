# AstraNull AWS staging — created resource ledger

Purpose: a complete, teardown-ready record of every cloud resource created for the
temporary AstraNull staging environment. **Delete everything in the Teardown section
when finished** — several of these resources bill continuously.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| AWS account | `423370095676` |
| IAM identity | `arn:aws:iam::423370095676:user/rootuser` |
| Local CLI profile | `astranull-staging` |
| Region | `us-east-1` |
| Deployed commit | `7a27f8ae2334794a4fc6b645867ab2a14198605a` |
| Branch | `feat/ddos-vector-coverage-remediation` |
| Created (UTC) | 2026-09-02 |
| Intended lifetime | 2–3 days |

## Safety baseline captured before provisioning

Verified at preflight so teardown can distinguish "ours" from "pre-existing":

- EC2 instances in this account: **0** across `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`, `us-west-1`,
  `us-west-2`, `eu-west-1`, `ap-south-1`.
- Key pairs: **0**. Elastic IPs: **0**. Security groups: **1** (the VPC default only).
- Default VPC `vpc-0be130ea1ba98f8ab` (`172.31.0.0/16`) with public subnets in all 6 AZs.
- Production instance `i-09169859dac12a2ee` (`34.199.50.155`, `us-east-1f`) returns
  `InvalidInstanceID.NotFound` in this account — **production lives in a different AWS
  account and is not reachable from these credentials.**

Everything listed under "Resources created" was therefore created by this deployment.
Anything not listed here pre-dates it.

## Naming convention

All resources are prefixed `astranull-staging-` and tagged:

- `Project=astranull`
- `Environment=staging`
- `ManagedBy=release-candidate-deploy`
- `Commit=7a27f8ae`
- `DeleteAfter=2026-09-05`

Teardown can therefore be driven by tag as well as by the explicit IDs below.

## Resources created

All created 2026-09-02 in `us-east-1`, account `423370095676`.

| # | Type | Name / ID | Region / AZ | Billing | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | EC2 key pair | `astranull-staging-key` / `key-05f04534b0d6e885c` | us-east-1 | none | created |
| 2 | Security group | `astranull-staging-sg` / `sg-024035b0882f38f85` | us-east-1 (vpc-0be130ea1ba98f8ab) | none | created |
| 3 | Elastic IP | `34.201.159.68` / `eipalloc-0eb5cd0107be2af0f` | us-east-1 | **hourly while allocated** | created |
| 4 | EIP association | `eipassoc-06132d1e00c1d3678` | us-east-1 | n/a | created |
| 5 | EC2 instance | `astranull-staging` / `i-00c7a0be239bc83ea` | us-east-1a | **hourly while running** | running |
| 6 | EBS root volume | `vol-0a37857b8647ffc31` (40 GB gp3, encrypted) | us-east-1a | **hourly while it exists** | attached, `DeleteOnTermination=true` |

Instance detail: `t3.large` (2 vCPU / 8 GB), AMI `ami-0d7f022123f8ff19d`
(Ubuntu 24.04 LTS amd64), subnet `subnet-055dad14e832d29fb`, IMDSv2 required.

### Network exposure

| Port | Source | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 22 | `108.191.200.121/32` (operator IP only) | SSH |
| 80 | `0.0.0.0/0` | ACME HTTP-01 challenge for TLS |
| 443 | `0.0.0.0/0` | HTTPS portal |

The portal is internet-reachable on 80/443. It is **not** unauthenticated: the deployment
runs `NODE_ENV=production`, which makes the app refuse `dev-headers` and `signed-session`
auth outright, so every API and portal route requires a verified RS256 OIDC bearer token.
SSH is restricted to a single operator address.

## Local artifacts (not cloud, but clean these up too)

| Path | Contains | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.aws/credentials` profile `astranull-staging` | access key for account 423370095676 | remove profile after teardown |
| `ops/aws/.staging-key.pem` | EC2 private key (gitignored) | delete after teardown |

## Teardown

Run in this order. Commands are filled in with real IDs as resources are created.

```bash
export P="--profile astranull-staging --region us-east-1"

# 1. Terminate the instance. Stops compute billing and, because
#    DeleteOnTermination=true, also deletes root volume vol-0a37857b8647ffc31.
aws ec2 terminate-instances $P --instance-ids i-00c7a0be239bc83ea
aws ec2 wait instance-terminated $P --instance-ids i-00c7a0be239bc83ea

# 2. Release the Elastic IP. Billed while allocated even when unattached.
aws ec2 release-address $P --allocation-id eipalloc-0eb5cd0107be2af0f

# 3. Delete the security group (only succeeds once the instance is fully terminated).
aws ec2 delete-security-group $P --group-id sg-024035b0882f38f85

# 4. Delete the key pair.
aws ec2 delete-key-pair $P --key-name astranull-staging-key

# 5. Confirm nothing of ours remains. All three must print 0.
aws ec2 describe-instances $P --filters Name=tag:Project,Values=astranull \
  --query 'length(Reservations[].Instances[?State.Name!=`terminated`][])'
aws ec2 describe-addresses $P --query 'length(Addresses)'
aws ec2 describe-volumes $P --filters Name=tag:Project,Values=astranull \
  --query 'length(Volumes)'

# 6. Local cleanup
rm -f ops/aws/.staging-key.pem
```

### One-shot teardown

```bash
P="--profile astranull-staging --region us-east-1"
aws ec2 terminate-instances $P --instance-ids i-00c7a0be239bc83ea \
  && aws ec2 wait instance-terminated $P --instance-ids i-00c7a0be239bc83ea \
  && aws ec2 release-address $P --allocation-id eipalloc-0eb5cd0107be2af0f \
  && aws ec2 delete-security-group $P --group-id sg-024035b0882f38f85 \
  && aws ec2 delete-key-pair $P --key-name astranull-staging-key \
  && rm -f ops/aws/.staging-key.pem \
  && echo "teardown complete"
```

### SSH access

```bash
ssh -i ops/aws/.staging-key.pem ubuntu@34.201.159.68
```

### Verify billing has stopped

An Elastic IP left allocated and an EBS volume left behind are the two things that
silently keep charging after an instance is gone. Step 5 above is what catches both.

## Credential rotation

The access key used for this deployment (account `423370095676`, IAM user `rootuser`,
ending `…JJFNH`) was supplied in a chat transcript and must be treated as **exposed**.
Delete it in IAM after teardown: IAM → Users → `rootuser` → Security credentials →
delete the key. An earlier key ending `…W2XQN` was already invalid
(`InvalidClientTokenId`) and should be removed too if it still exists.

Full key IDs are deliberately not recorded here so they do not enter git history; match
on the suffix in the IAM console.
